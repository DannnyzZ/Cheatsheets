# 3. INCIDENT HANDLING CHECKLIST

**An Incident Handling Checklist** is a critical document that outlines the necessary steps and procedures for responding to a security incident, such as a cyber-attack, data breach, or other types of security breaches. The purpose of the checklist is to help incident responders promptly and efficiently respond to the incident, minimize its impact on the organization, and prevent future incidents from occurring.

## Contents

The Incident Handling Checklist is typically structured into three main sections:
- Detection and Analysis: This section includes steps for detecting and analyzing the incident, identifying the type and scope of the incident, and assessing its impact on the organization. This section also outlines the communication procedures and escalation protocols to follow during the incident.

- Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: This section focuses on containing the incident, eradicating the threat, and restoring normal operations. It includes procedures for isolating affected systems, removing malware or malicious actors, restoring data and systems, and verifying the integrity of the systems.

- Post-Incident Activity: This section outlines the procedures for conducting a post-incident review, documenting lessons learned, and improving incident response capabilities for future incidents. This section also includes procedures for notifying relevant stakeholders, such as customers or regulatory bodies, and complying with any legal or regulatory requirements.

Having an Incident Handling Checklist in place is essential for organizations to quickly and effectively respond to security incidents. By following a structured and well-defined incident response process, organizations can minimize the impact of the incident, protect sensitive data and systems, and maintain customer trust.
