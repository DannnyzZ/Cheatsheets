# 2. DOMAIN HIERARCHY

**A Domain Hierarchy** refers to the organization of internet domains in a hierarchical structure. The top-level domain (TLD) is at the root of the hierarchy and is followed by second-level domains, third-level domains, and so on. Each level represents a more specific subdomain of the previous level. The hierarchy can be used to provide structure and organization to the internet, making it easier to find and access information.

## Contents

This cheatsheet contains the hierarchy models of domains. It includes:
- Hierarchic model of domains;
- Name, functions, definitions and examples of real domains;
- Model of URL (Uniform Resource Locator), with brief description of its parts.

**All of the components are tightly connected to each other with specific colors, so it's easier to distinguish certain parts of the schema. Colors play a big role in this model, so keep that in mind while reading it.**
