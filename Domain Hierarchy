This cheatsheet contains the hierarchy models of domains. It includes:
1. hierarchic model of domains
2. name, functions, definitions and examples of real domains
3. model of URL (Uniform Resource Locator), with brief description of its parts.

All of the components are tightly connected to eachother with specific colours, so its easier to distinguish certain parts of the schema. Colors play a big role in this model, so keep that in mind while reading it.
