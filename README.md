### OSI Model

TThe OSI Model is a conceptual framework that defines how data is transmitted between devices on a network. This cheatsheet provides information about each layer of the OSI Model, including:
- name;
- function;
- type of data processed;
- common protocols and standards.

### Domain Hierarchy

This cheatsheet contains the hierarchy models of domains. It includes:
- Hierarchic model of domains;
- Name, functions, definitions and examples of real domains;
- Model of URL (Uniform Resource Locator), with brief description of its parts.

All of the components are tightly connected to each other with specific colors, so it's easier to distinguish certain parts of the schema. Colors play a big role in this model, so keep that in mind while reading it.
