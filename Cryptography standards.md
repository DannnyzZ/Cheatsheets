# 6. CRYPTOGRAPHY STANDARDS

**Cryptography standards** are a set of protocols, algorithms, and techniques used to ensure secure communication and information exchange. They are intended to provide data confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. This cheat sheet includes the following information for each standard:
- Name: the name of the cryptographic standard;
- Symmetric or asymmetric: whether the standard is based on symmetric or asymmetric encryption;
- How it works: a brief explanation of how the standard processes data (e.g., block cipher, stream cipher);
- Variations: any known variations or versions of the standard;
- Possible vectors of attacks: potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by an attacker to compromise the security of the standard.
